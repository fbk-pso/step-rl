## About the project

Planning - devising a strategy to achieve a desired objective - is one of the basic forms of intelligence. Temporal planning studies the automated synthesis of strategies when time and temporal constraints matter: it is one of the most strategic fields of Artificial Intelligence, with applications in autonomous robotics, logistics, flexible production, and many other fields.

Historically, research on temporal planning has followed a general-purpose framework: a generic engine searches for the strategy by reasoning on the problem statement (i.e. the starting condition and the desired objective), as well as on a formal model of the domain (i.e. the possible actions). Despite substantial progress in the recent years, domain-independent temporal planning still suffers from scalability issues, and fails to deal with real-word problems. The alternative is to devise ad-hoc, domain-specific solutions that, although efficient, are costly to develop, rigid to maintain, and often inapplicable in non-nominal situations.

STEP-RL will study the foundations of a new approach to Temporal Planning that will be domain-independent and efficient at the same time. The idea is to adopt a framework based on Reinforcement Learning, where a domain-independent temporal planner is specialized with respect to the domain at hand. STEP-RL will continuously improve its ability to solve temporal planning problems by learning from experience, thus becoming increasingly efficient by means of self-adaptation.

STEP-RL will advance the state of the art in temporal planning beyond the "efficiency vs flexibility" dilemma, that we faced in many industrial projects of the PSO unit.
